# Artificial Intelligence Lab Experiments  

This repository contains all lab assignments from our 3rd-year **Artificial Intelligence** course. Each `Assignment_##.ipynb` notebook steps through a classic AI problem combining theory, code, and results to build your understanding of intelligent algorithms.

## Topics Covered  
- **Fundamental Programming**: List Manipulation and Basic Algorithms (Max-Value Search)  
- **Uninformed & Informed Search**: BFS, DFS, Bi-Directional Search, Best-First Search, Uniform-Cost Search, A* Search 
- **Path Planning & Navigation**: Robot Path planning, Multi-Goal Navigation, Puzzle Solving  
- **Planning & Scheduling**: A*-based Task Planner, Comparative Analysis of Search Methods  
- **Heuristic & Optimization**: Hill-Climbing, Genetic Algorithms  
- **Problem-Solving Challenges**: Water-Jug, 8-Puzzle  
- **Adversarial Search**: 4-Queens, Tower of Hanoi  

## Repository Structure  
- All notebooks live under the `AI_Lab/` directory.
- Each file is named `Assignment_##.ipynb` and contains:
  - A problem statement
  - Step-by-Step Implementation in Python
  - Sample Inputs, Outputs, and Visualizations
