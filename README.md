# Artificial Intelligence Lab Experiments  

This repository contains all lab assignments from our 3rd-year **Artificial Intelligence** course. Each `Assignment_##.ipynb` notebook steps through a classic AI problemâ€”combining theory, code, and results to build your understanding of intelligent algorithms.

## Topics Covered  
- **Fundamental Programming**: list manipulation and basic algorithms (max-value search)  
- **Uninformed & Informed Search**: BFS, DFS, bi-directional search, Best-First, Uniform-Cost, A*  
- **Path Planning & Navigation**: robot path planning, multi-goal navigation, puzzle solving  
- **Planning & Scheduling**: A*-based task planner, comparative analysis of search methods  
- **Heuristic & Optimization**: hill-climbing, genetic algorithms  
- **Problem-Solving Challenges**: water-jug, 8-puzzle  
- **Adversarial Search**: 4-Queens, Tower of Hanoi  

## Repository Structure  
- All notebooks live under the `AI_Lab/` directory :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Each file is named `Assignment_##.ipynb` and contains:
  - A problem statement  
  - Step-by-step implementation in Python  
  - Sample inputs, outputs, and visualizations
